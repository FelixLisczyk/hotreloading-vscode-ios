## Support HotReloading

One caveat to support HotReloading is to ensure the `derivedDataPath` passed to `xcodebuild` matches that when building with Xcode.

Xcode (by default) uses "Unique" build locations for each project: [Xcode DerivedData Hashes](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/xcode_deriveddata_hashes.html)

Once the `xcodegen` task has been run the following command can be used to output the `$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` including the unique location (for this demo):

```shell
$xcodebuild -project ./Demo.xcodeproj -scheme Demo -showBuildSettings | grep -m 1 "BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR" | grep -oEi "\/.*"
```

Output:

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Demo-avuzscipzqxczrbltxhlvbnxujdo/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos
```

This in turn means the `.vscode/launch.json` iOS Debug `program` needs to be updated to resolve to the output `*.app` (`$CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH`)
